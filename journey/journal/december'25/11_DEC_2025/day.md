# Nothing changes if nothing changes

Facts, ain't it ? <br />
Im tired of things being the same, feeling the same way, being the same way. This morning I finally woke up <br />
with a spark of new energy, which I greatly needed to get things moving. Thanks, God :) <br /> <br />
I have got the whole day ahead of me. Need to plan out my tasks, prepare for office and encounter adventures <br />
along the way! <br /> <br />
But first, let me get my coffee haha ☕️
