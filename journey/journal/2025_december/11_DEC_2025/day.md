# Nothing changes if nothing changes

Facts, ain't it ? <br />
Im tired of things being the same, feeling the same way, being the same way. This morning I finally woke up <br />
with a spark of new energy, which I greatly needed to get things moving. Thanks, God :) <br /> <br />
I have got the whole day ahead of me. Need to plan out my tasks, prepare for office and encounter adventures <br />
along the way! <br /> <br />
But first, let me get my coffee haha ☕️<br />

A lot happened post coffee, and to summarize the events, I went to office, and finally solved all the tagged questions <br />
for the first lecture.<br />

However, I am facing an issue at the machine OS level in syncing my work from mac and my enterprise laptop. <br />
Apparently, there is a path length limit issue on Windows, and even on enabling some registry settings,<br />
the issues still persists. <br />

Thank God, I get to use a mac for my personal work at least! However, I still need to figure a way out though... <br />

As I was returning from office, I parked my car directly at the 'Streets Of Europe' rather than my flat straightaway <br />
Fancy seeing my flatmates there! We all had a sip of coffee and exchanged pleasantries. <br />

Did a little workout in the evening, had a timely dinner, and went to bed at around 10 PM. A little later than what I <br />
originally intended, but cool, I will work on that.

That's it!<br />
Alright, Bye for now
