# Winter is Coming ? It has arrived!
Yes, and it is here to stay for about a month or two more <br />

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the cold, but even I had to put on a few extra layers to stop chattering! <br />
What's surprising is that the temperature in Pune has hit almost what it is currently in Delhi-NCR, varying <br />
just by 1 degree!

As per the usual, I woke up early today, similar to yesterday (Thanks, God) and continued my problem-solving <br />
from where I had left it earlier. I am noticing this one thing about myself, that I am a bit of a control freak when <br />
it comes to management. When it comes to organizing my work, I cater to structuring it precisely, much like <br />
arranging garments under different sections of a wardrobe, placing each piece where it suits and fits more. <br />

Now this may sound nice, but it does have it's trade offs. I find that overall, it is much more time-consuming. <br />
I am able to solve the question with the same speed, however packaging the question, the answer and related <br />
material takes an extra over head. <br />
I wonder whether I should continue this practice. <br />

Also, this might be touching on a deeply personal level as for why I am not able to let certain things play on<br />
its own accord, and feel the urge to get the outcome to the best situation. Interesting...

On a lighter note, before the cold completely gets to me, let me brew some hot coffee and give my bones a <br />
chance to breathe haha <br />
